I have created this application where I used custom themes, I've used Getx State Management.
You can toggle device's light and dark theme to change the theme of app.
After clicking login, you will find a drawer button in the left of appbar.
on clicking the drawer, you will find number of categories to select for the news.
When you click on national, you will get to see the news.
also logout button is there.
Below Sign in , you will find a sign in button, you can check that too.
